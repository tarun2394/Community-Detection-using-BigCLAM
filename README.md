# Community-Detection-using-BigCLAM

In this project, we explore network community detection using the BigCLAM algorithm. An algorithm is developed to find overlapping communities in the given network â€“ which means a node can present in multiple communities in the given network. We formulate the community detection as a non-negative matrix factorization with maximum log-likelihood estimation problem by parametrizing node strength in communities
